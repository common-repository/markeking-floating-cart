A lightweigt, blazing fast plugin to display the contents of the shopping cart in floating box

== Description ==

A **super-lightweight** plugin to display the contents of the shopping cart summarized in a floating box . For WooCommerce .

Avoids the risk that once users have added the product to cart not know how to continue shopping or find the shopping cart .

With this plugin, your customers will always find it.

You can be sure that customers always find the shopping cart.

Floating Cart MarkeKing shows the total amount of the shopping cart and the number of products in it , in a floating box at the bottom right.

It will be shown on every page that the user visits if the shopping cart have products, except at the checkout and in view cart page, obviously.

I like plugins that only have the features I need , rather than have dozens of features and options that do not need to increase the load time of my site unnecessarily.

It is the best the plugin does not have a lot of features or css styles or scripts , is super lightweight . This will not affect the least to the loading speed of your website.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the content of the zip package to `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. It is ready.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= How I can configure the plugin? =

You do not need to configure anything , no administration panel , simply install and floating cart will be displayed when a product to the shopping cart is added.

= Where the floating car shows? =

Once no products in the cart , the cart is displayed in the lower right corner.

It will be shown on every page that the user visits , except at the checkout and in view cart page, obviously.
